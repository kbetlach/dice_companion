# RPG Dice Companion

This is a simple web app created using HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, and JavaScript. I was inspired to make this when after starting a fresh Dungeons and Dragons campaign with a new group, one of our players didn't own any of his own dice, and I thought it'd be handy if he had access to a simple dice rolling app.

On load, the app defaults to 1 dice selected with no modifier. Users can click the picture of the dice they wish to roll, and the result will pop up on the screen. Users can increase the quantity of dice rolled at once, as well as any modifiers that apply to their roll. A message will pop up under the result indicating what the maximum roll can be.

Give it a try!
